## Research Workflow

### 1. Define Research Question
```markdown
## Research Brief
**Question:** How should we implement real-time notifications?

**Context:**
- React/Next.js application
- 10k+ concurrent users expected
- Need instant updates for messages and alerts

**Constraints:**
- Must work with existing auth system
- Budget: prefer self-hosted solutions
- Timeline: 2 weeks to implement
```

### 2. Gather Sources
```markdown
## Sources Consulted
1. Next.js documentation - Server-Sent Events
2. WebSocket vs SSE comparison articles
3. Socket.io documentation and examples
4. Pusher alternatives (self-hosted)
5. Redis pub/sub patterns
```

### 3. Analyze Options
```markdown
## Option 1: WebSockets (Socket.io)
**Pros:**
- Bi-directional communication
- Large ecosystem
- Built-in reconnection logic

**Cons:**
- More complex to scale
- Requires sticky sessions
- Higher server resources

**Implementation Effort:** Medium
**Cost:** Self-hosted, Redis for pub/sub

## Option 2: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
**Pros:**
- Simple HTTP-based
- Native browser support
- Easy to scale horizontally

**Cons:**
- One-way only (server to client)
- Limited browser connections (6 per domain)
- No binary data support

**Implementation Effort:** Low
**Cost:** Minimal, standard HTTP

## Option 3: Firebase Cloud Messaging
**Pros:**
- Fully managed
- Mobile support included
- Reliable delivery

**Cons:**
- Vendor lock-in
- Monthly costs scale with usage
- Less control over infrastructure

**Implementation Effort:** Low
**Cost:** $0-$500/month depending on scale
```

### 4. Make Recommendation
```markdown
## Recommendation: Server-Sent Events

**Rationale:**
- Fits the one-way notification use case perfectly
- Simplest implementation for Next.js
- Easiest to scale horizontally
- No additional infrastructure needed

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create API route for SSE endpoint
2. Implement Redis pub/sub for multi-instance
3. Add reconnection logic on client
4. Implement fallback for older browsers

**Example Code:** [Link to CodeSandbox demo]

**Estimated Timeline:** 3-5 days
```

## Research Patterns

### Pattern 1: Technology Selection
When choosing between alternatives:

1. **List requirements** (must-have vs nice-to-have)
2. **Identify candidates** (3-5 options)
3. **Compare objectively** (table with criteria)
4. **Check community health** (GitHub stars, recent updates)
5. **Verify compatibility** (with existing stack)
6. **Assess learning curve** (team expertise)
7. **Consider long-term** (maintenance, support)

Example comparison table:
```markdown
| Criteria          | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-------------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance       | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐     |
| Documentation     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐   | ⭐⭐⭐     | ⭐⭐⭐⭐    |
| Community Size    | 50k ⭐   | 120k ⭐  | 15k ⭐   |
| TypeScript        | ✅       | ✅       | ❌       |
| Last Updated      | 2 days   | 1 week   | 6 months |
| Bundle Size       | 45KB     | 120KB    | 30KB     |
| Learning Curve    | Low      | Medium   | High     |
```

### Pattern 2: Bug Investigation
When researching errors:

1. **Copy exact error message** (including stack trace)
2. **Search GitHub issues** for the library
3. **Check StackOverflow** with version tags
4. **Review changelog** for breaking changes
5. **Test with minimal reproduction**
6. **Check browser/node version compatibility**

### Pattern 3: API Integration
When integrating third-party services:

1. **Read official documentation** (not blog posts)
2. **Check rate limits** and quotas
3. **Review pricing** (especially scaling costs)
4. **Test authentication** flow
5. **Verify webhook** handling
6. **Check error responses**
7. **Plan for API downtime**

### Pattern 4: Security Research
When investigating security concerns:

1. **Check CVE databases** for known vulnerabilities
2. **Review security advisories** for dependencies
3. **Consult OWASP** guidelines
4. **Test proof-of-concept** in isolated environment
5. **Never execute** untrusted code
6. **Document findings** for security review
