## Task 1: Add User Authentication

### Description
Implement user authentication with email/password and OAuth (Google, GitHub) support.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can register with email/password
- [ ] Users can login with email/password
- [ ] Users can login with Google OAuth
- [ ] Users can login with GitHub OAuth
- [ ] Passwords are hashed and secure
- [ ] Session management implemented

- [ ] Tests cover all authentication flows

### Context
The application currently has no authentication. We need a secure authentication system that supports both traditional email/password and OAuth providers. The system should be scalable and follow security best practices.

### Agent Assignment
**Workflow:** feature

1. @research - Find best practices for authentication in [your stack]
2. @coder - Implement authentication system
3. @tester - Create authentication tests
4. @integrator - Wire up auth to existing components
5. @docs - Document authentication flow

Several pages are loading slowly due to inefficient database queries. Need to identify and optimize problematic queries.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Slow queries identified and documented
- [ ] Indexes added where appropriate
- [ ] N+1 query problems resolved
- [ ] Page load times improved by >50%
- [ ] Query performance tests added

### Context
Users are complaining about slow page loads, especially on the dashboard and user list pages. Database monitoring shows some queries taking 3-5 seconds.

- [ ] Smooth transitions between themes
- [ ] Accessibility maintained in dark mode

### Context
Many users have requested dark mode. This should be a system-wide theme that persists across sessions.

### Agent Assignment
**Workflow:** feature

1. @research - Find dark mode implementation patterns for [your stack]
2. @coder - Implement theme system and dark mode styles
3. @tester - Test theme switching and persistence
4. @integrator - Apply dark mode to all components
5. @docs - Document theme system usage

- [ ] Root cause of payment failures identified
- [ ] Payment error handling improved
- [ ] Clear error messages shown to users
- [ ] Failed payments logged for debugging
- [ ] Retry mechanism implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Tests prevent regression

### Context
Several users have reported that their payments fail but they don't receive any error message. This is causing frustration and lost revenue.

### Agent Assignment
**Workflow:** bugfix

1. @research - Investigate payment logs and error patterns
2. @stuck - Analyze if we're hitting known payment gateway issues
3. @coder - Implement fix and better error handling
4. @tester - Add payment error scenario tests
5. @integrator - Ensure error handling is consistent

## Task 6: Deploy to Production

### Description
Deploy version 2.0 to production environment with zero downtime.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All tests pass in staging
- [ ] Database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Deployment doesn't cause downtime
- [ ] Rollback plan documented
- [ ] Production health checks pass
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured

### Context
Version 2.0 includes major new features and needs to be deployed carefully to production with no downtime.

### Agent Assignment
**Workflow:** deploy

1. @tester - Run full test suite
2. @deployer - Deploy to staging
3. @tester - Verify staging environment
4. @deployer - Deploy to production (blue-green)
5. @tester - Verify production health checks

## Tips for Writing Tasks

### Good Task Descriptions
- **Be specific**: "Add search functionality to product page" not "improve search"
- **Include context**: Why is this needed? What problem does it solve?
- **Define success**: Clear acceptance criteria that can be verified
- **Right-size**: Not too big (split large tasks) or too small (combine trivial tasks)

### Agent Selection
- **Single-agent tasks**: Straightforward implementation, testing, or documentation
- **Multi-agent workflows**: Complex features requiring multiple specialties
- **Use workflows**: Leverage predefined workflows (feature, bugfix, deploy)

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Testable**: Can be objectively verified
- **Complete**: Covers all aspects of "done"
- **Clear**: No ambiguity about what needs to happen

### Context
- **Background**: What led to this task?
- **Constraints**: Time, budget, technical limitations
- **Dependencies**: What needs to be done first?
- **References**: Links to designs, specs, related issues
